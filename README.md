# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a bank customer will **churn (leave the bank)** based on their demographic, financial, and account activity features.  
It applies **machine learning classification models** ‚Äî Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest ‚Äî and performs **hyperparameter optimization** using `GridSearchCV`.

## üß≠ Overview

Customer churn is a major problem in the banking sector, directly affecting profitability and long-term growth.  
The goal of this project is to identify customers who are most likely to **exit** based on their characteristics and transaction history.

The pipeline includes:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding (One-Hot, Ordinal)
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation with ROC-AUC, accuracy, and other metrics
